## Daphnia Detection and Analysis: General

Our program is an automated pipeline for scientific analysis of animals of the genus *Daphnia*. Detailed information about development and functionality in PAPERLINK.
We provide conda environments with package versions we used, but functionality is dependend on the cuda version you use.

You can also find docker images [here](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/fipsik/daphniadetector/general).

Models for CPU and GPU as well as test images can be found in this github. This also includes a folder structure to automatically create new docker images
We recommend developers to use the program without docker and GPU. They need the GPU files and Common Code from Github and the Models from SOMEWHERE.
